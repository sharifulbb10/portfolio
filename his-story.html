<h1 class="heading">Story of Shariful Islam</h1>
<p>I was born in 2001, in Shahrasti, a place in Bangladesh. My childhood was spent in our village, Saifullakandi. I was amazed to see the people of the village, so friendly, cooperative, hardworking. I think every child of the cities should be sent back to the villages, because the natural surroundings of the villages act as an amazing schools for them, to practice their inner strengths & to strengthen their creativity. I luckily got that chance. My first techer was my father. Actually, he is the greatest coach, mentor, teacher, everything for me, for my whole life. But I am so stupid to fulfill his dream with me! I am always a failed person, whatever I am, or whatever I will become. My primary & high school were nere to my home. I studied there. All of my teachers are my great contributors of my moral & primary education. May Allah keep them good, wherever & however they are staying today, in this globe or in the heaven. <br>My higher secondary study was in Narsingdi, in Narsingdi Govt. College, where I proved myself a loser, in the most important stage of my life. I failed to make a good result, & even failed to admit anywhere. At last, I admitted to an affiliated institution of textile education. I was a good for nothing that time. But now I am proving myself to be something necessary. And I am doing well, beacuse some people are feeling some igo-problems with me, nowadays. That proves that, I am being someone, gradually!</p>
<p>Till now, this is my story...</p>
